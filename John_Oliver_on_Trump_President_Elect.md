John Olivers **Last Week Tonight** [Video on Trump as President Elect](https://youtu.be/Uv06XdjbVIM).

Calls on us all to stay and fight. Monitoring Legislation that is going through.  Voting.  (Remember both Trump & Pence [have pledged to curtail womens rights to abortion](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion-donations-idUSKBN13A2L8), and Trump has said Roe v Wade should be over-turned & he would appoint an anti-abortion justice to the Supreme Court.)

The president-elect is masterful denier of both reality and responsibility. His Chief Strategist is Steve Bannon of Breitbart.

_If I become President oh, do they have such problems.  I will open up the libel laws, so that when they write purposely negative, and horrible and false articles we can sue them._

You need to support actual journalism by buying a subscription to actual newspapers New York Times or the Washington Post

This is not normal.  Write it on a post-it note and stick it on your fridge.

A clan-backed, misogynist internet troll is going to be delivering the next State of the Union address.  Fired up?  Ready to go!
